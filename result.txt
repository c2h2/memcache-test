==test env==
mac book air snb ultra low volt i5
ruby memcached gem + localhost memcache(512MB) via port 11211


==results==
===memcached results===
1. memcached performance: 1M insert items cost around 60second, around 16k insertion per second. and cpu usage ~ 30%
2. memory for very simple item (1m Records) around 100MB, 64byte key + 2 byte item cost around 160MB
3. read cost around the same time vs write. Hashing is probably very costly in memcached.


===md5 / sha2 comparison===
m5 around half of the computational time and half of the memory cost.


===ruby loop is very fast===
1M loop around 0.2 second



==further work==
try diff ruby memecache gem. try on linux and other env.
